        <p>Welcome to our website. We placed it here more as a basic information source than a marketing tool.</p>
        <p>There are three documents here which pretty much summarize what we do. Please read any one and then either contact us via the WhatsApp link or the contact form or via email or phone call. From that point we will have a great deal more information for you.</p>
        <p>After you have an idea of what we do, whatever your query, we will do our best to respond in a way that is helpful to you.</p>
        <p>Pig Farming or Pork production is one of the most overlooked aspects of profitable agribusiness in Nigeria.</p>
        <p>Most people do not know that it is the most consumed meat in the world followed by chicken. Or that Pig Farming is the most profitable section of livestock farming.</p>
        <p>At least 120 million Nigerians consume about 16kg of pig meat per year each. 1kg of pig meat currently sells for at least N2500. Multiply that by 16kg by 120 million. The facts are all over the Internet for you to confirm. These are actually conservative estimates.</p>
        <p><strong>HERE'S THE BOMB!!</strong></p>
        <p>Nigeria imports more Pork than it produces to meet its local demand â€” in fact, more than 60%. Please check online to confirm.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons for this. Pigs have a negative PR in Nigeria, most of which is mythical and false. Also, traditional farmers are still the major players in the sector and they still do things the same old way, which is far from efficient.</p>
        <p>One female Pig well taken care of, can give you 25 offspring at least in a year. A pig farm you start with just five females following our plan will have grown into a farming business grossing at least N30 million annually within 6 years. (Reach out. We will send you hard data)</p>
        <p>What if you started with ten females? What if you started with 50 females? Do the calculations yourself. This is how China does it.</p>
        <p>That is why the only farmer on the Forbes list of global billionaires is a pig farmer.</p>
        <p><strong>SO WHAT ARE WE SAYING?</strong></p>
        <p>Pig farming business is still a ground floor opportunity in Nigeria. A lot of middle-aged people have no pensions. Pig business is a great idea to plan retirement. A lot of younger people are unemployed. Pig business can accommodate thousands now and we still will not be able to meet demand.</p>
        <p>We are a complete source of support for you if you consider taking the Pig business seriously. If you follow the rules, you will only lose money when people stop eating and the population stops growing.</p>
        <p>Agriculture is the way forward for Nigeria â€” and Pig Farming is the easiest to start and probably the most profitable aspect of agriculture in Nigeria.</p>
        <p>But you have to do it right. Follow the rules and you will smile to the bank.</p>
